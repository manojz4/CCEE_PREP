Session 1: Basics of Storage
    Types of Storage: Includes Direct-Attached Storage (DAS), Network-Attached Storage (NAS), and Storage Area Network (SAN).

    DAS : (Direct-Attached Storage)
        - usb connector
        - storage directly connected with devices , server , computer 
        - small busisness
        - simple in use and to config 
        - cost low 
        - maintenance low
        - don't support to share data over Network

    NAS : (Network-Attached Storage)
        - ethernet connector
        - specialized comp/server
            not genral purpose
        - provide storage services to devices on N/W
        - IP address & network space
        - web browser 
            control and config the storage from the web browser 
        - storage upgrade 
            scaling is easy , flexible 

    SAN : (Storage Area Network)
        - storage -> FC switch ( Fibre channel ) -> mutiple servers 
        - host bus adapter 
            - connet server with storage over the network 
        - complex 
        - medium - large size business
        - security & high performance 
            - performance - fiber optic cables 
        - highly scalable 
        eg. misssion critical applications
        


    Protocols: Common protocols like SCSI, Fibre Channel (FC), and iSCSI used for storage connectivity.

    scsi : small computer system inteface 
    iscsi : internet small computer system interface 
        - enables multiple server 
        - user to access network drives over TCP /IP
        - by using shared storage
            iSCSI initiaor :
                - hardware an d sofware installed on a server to send data

            iSCSI target :
                - server that host the storage resources and allow access to the storage 
                - transport block level data between iSCSI initiator on a server and iSCSI target on a storage device 
                - over TCP/IP LAN or WAN connection 

            - on arrival iSCSI protocol disassembles the packet separating the SCSI commands 
            - OS will recognize the storage as being a locally connected SCSI device .

            - high performance fiber channel based storage arrays and enterprise data centers for disaster recovery systems

                    | 24 B  |           2112 B              |

                    - header :
                        - 24 bytes 
                    - payload

    Components of a Disk Drive: Covers physical components such as platters, heads, and controllers.

        Platter : 
            - circular , flat disk with maganetic material where data store
            - Platter spin at very high speed typically 5400 - 15000 per minute while data is read from or written to them 
        
        Heads : 
            - each platter has a head that move across the serface of platter to read and write data 
            - the head is attached to an actuator arm assembly 
        
        Actuator arm :
            - this is mechanical arm moves the head across the serface of platter  
            - it is controlled by the disk controller to position the head over the connect track on the platter 

        Controller : 
            - manage the operation of the entire disk drive 
            - include component like the disk controller , cache memory , and other electronics that manage data access , transfer rates , error correction 

        Spindle : 
            - motor that rotates the platter 
            - it ensures that the platter spin at a constant speed and synchronize with the head movements

Session 2: RAID and Intelligent Storage Systems

RAID Level Performance and Availability Considerations
    RAID Levels:

    RAID 0 (Striping): 
        - Distributes data across multiple disks for improved performance but offers no redundancy.
    
    RAID 1 (Mirroring): 
        - Mirrors data across two disks for redundancy, but capacity is limited to the size of one disk.
    
    RAID 5 (Striping with Parity): 
        - Distributes data and parity information across multiple disks for redundancy and performance.
    
    RAID 6 (Striping with Double Parity): 
        - Similar to RAID 5 but includes additional parity information for enhanced fault tolerance.
    
    Performance Considerations:

    Read/Write Operations: 
        - Different RAID levels affect read and write performance due to varying data distribution and redundancy mechanisms.
    
    Parity Calculation: 
        - RAID levels with parity (e.g., RAID 5, RAID 6) involve parity calculation during write operations, impacting performance.
    
    Controller Cache: 
        - RAID performance can be influenced by the presence and size of controller caches for caching frequently accessed data.
    
    Availability Considerations:

    Fault Tolerance: 
        - RAID provides fault tolerance against disk failures depending on the RAID level used.
    
    Rebuild Times: 
        - Rebuilding a RAID array after a disk failure can impact availability during the rebuild process, especially for larger arrays.
    
    Components and Benefits of an Intelligent Storage System
    
    Components:

        Caching: 
            - Use of cache memory (RAM or SSD) to temporarily store frequently accessed data, improving read and write performance.
        
        Tiered Storage: 
            - Automatic placement of data on different storage tiers (e.g., SSDs for high-performance, HDDs for capacity) based on usage patterns.
        
        Data Deduplication: 
            - Identifying and eliminating duplicate copies of data to reduce storage capacity requirements.
        
        Thin Provisioning: 
            - Allocating storage space dynamically as needed rather than pre-allocating all storage upfront.
    
    Benefits:

        Improved Performance: 
            - Caching and tiered storage enhance data access speeds, especially for frequently accessed data.
         
        Cost Efficiency: 
            -Thin provisioning and data deduplication reduce storage costs by optimizing resource utilization.
        
        Scalability: 
            - Intelligent storage systems can scale to accommodate growing data volumes and changing performance requirements.
        
        Data Integrity: 
            - Features like RAID and snapshotting ensure data integrity and provide recovery options in case of data corruption or loss.
